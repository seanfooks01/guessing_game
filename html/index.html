    <h2>Welcome to my Zelda Guessing Game!</h2>
    <p>
      Your adventure begins in the land of Hyrule. You start out by choosing your name and a weapon. Choose carefully because this will be your only weapon throughout the game. After choosing your weapon, you will then be asked to choose your magic weapon.

        <ul>
          <li>You get to choose your <em>Name</em>!</li>
          <li>You also choose your <em>Weapon</em>!</li>

          <aside><img src="images/sword.png"></aside>
            <ul>
              <li>The Master Sword, also known as "The Blade of Evil's Bane" and the "Hyrule Sword", is a magic sword that often acts as the ultimate weapon for Link as the chosen hero to defeat Ganon and doubles as a key to the Sacred Realm.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><h3><em>The Elven Bow</em></h3></li>
            <aside><img src="images/bow.png"></aside>
            <ul>
              <li>This enchanted bow was crafted in the land of Rivendell. It was crafted using the wood of an Ent, and the hair of a Unicorn. Its target is never missed!</li>
            </ul>
          <li><h3><em>The Hammer of Drethis</em></h3></li>
            <aside><img src="images/hammer.png"></aside>
            <ul>
              <li>The Hammer of Drethis was forged in the mines of Death Mountain. Thor, the God of Thunder, made a clone of his hammer and gave it to King Drethis as a gift. After leaving, King Drethis used the hammer only for evil, so Thor banished the King's soul into the hammer, and threw the hammer in the deepest part of the earth. It was soon then discovered by the minors of Goron, and now resides in the Hyrule castle. Its blow is devistating to its victims!</li>
